//Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

//Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a = 10;
let b = 3;
console.log(`Sum obtained when we add ${a} and ${b} is: ${a + b}`);

//Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
let num1 = 96;
let num2 = 33;
console.log(`Result obtained when we sbstract ${num2} from ${num1} is: ${num1 - num2}`);

//Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let mul = a * b;
console.log(`Result obtained when we multiply ${a} by ${b} is: ${mul}`);

//Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let num3 = 55;
let num4 = 5;
console.log(`Remainder obtained when we divide ${num3} by ${num4} is: ${num3 / num4}`);

//Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let remainder = a % b;
console.log(`Remainder obtained when we divide ${a} by ${b} is: ${remainder}`)
