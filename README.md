# JavaScript30: Quest for Mastery in 30 Days

Welcome to JavaScript30! This repository is dedicated to a 30-day challenge aimed at mastering JavaScript through daily assignments and activities. Each day, you will tackle new challenges designed to strengthen your understanding and skills in JavaScript.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Learn and practice core JavaScript concepts.
- Build proficiency through hands-on coding exercises.
- Explore different aspects of JavaScript each day.

## How It Works

Each day's folder contains:
- **Assignment**: Description and tasks for the day's challenge.
- **Code**: JavaScript code files to complete the tasks.
- **README**: Instructions for the day's tasks and activities.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javascript30.git
    cd javascript30
    ```

2. **Navigate to the day's folder:**
    ```sh
    cd dayX
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser** to view and interact with the results of the day's challenges.

# Day 1: Variables and Data Types

## Tasks/Activities

### Activity 1: Variable Declaration
- **Task 1:** Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 2: Constant Declaration
- **Task 2:** Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 3: Data Types
- **Task 3:** Create variables of different data types (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables
- **Task 4:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### Activity 5: Understanding `const`
- **Task 5:** Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

## Feature Requests

### Variable Types Console Log
Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

### Reassignment Demo
Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

## Achievements

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
