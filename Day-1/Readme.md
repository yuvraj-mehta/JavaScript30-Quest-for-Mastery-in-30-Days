# Day 1: Variables and Data Types

## Tasks/Activities

### Activity 1: Variable Declaration
- **Task 1:** Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 2: Constant Declaration
- **Task 2:** Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 3: Data Types
- **Task 3:** Create variables of different data types (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables
- **Task 4:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### Activity 5: Understanding `const`
- **Task 5:** Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

## Feature Requests

### Variable Types Console Log
Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

### Reassignment Demo
Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

## Achievements

By the end of these activities, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

## Usage

1. Open the developer console in your browser to see the output of each task.
2. Run the scripts to observe the behavior and output as described in the tasks and feature requests.
